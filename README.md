# DuplicateFinder
Simple python3 command line app for recursively searching a directory for duplicate files.

I know this could simply be a gist, but I dream of this application becoming something a bit more robust, maybe even with a GUI in the future?  This is a huge problem for people who take a lot of pictures and don't store them well.  Could it be modified to work on remote collections of photos hosted in the cloud?
